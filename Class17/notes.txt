Types of Variable
There are 3 types of variables local, instance and static

Class Vars{
int age=10; // instance variable (inside the class but not inside of method)
static double weight=2.5; // static

Void method(){
String name="Kishan"; // local variable (if inside a method it is called a local variable

}
}
local variables:
If a variable is defined inside a method or loop or switch or any other block of code it is called local variable.

instance variable:
If a variable is not declared inside a method, but it is inside a class then it is called variable.

Static variable:
If a variable is not declared inside a method, but it is inside a class, and it has static keyword with
it then it is called a static variable.

When to use which types of variable:
local variables:
local variables should always be preferred over instance and static variables
why because they occupy the  computer's memory for very, very short amount of time
as soon as their purpose is served Java destroys them.
Pros:
Save memory
Cons:
not accessible outside of method/block of code
instance variable:
when we want to share something in all in multiple methods of a class and the information is
expected to be different from object to object we should go with instance variables
Pros:
accessible in all the methods of a class
Cons:
occupy the computer's memory for longer than local variables.

Static variables:
if instance variable have the static keyword with them, they are called static variable
Pros:
single memory location for all the objects of that class
cons:
can hold only one value for all the object and stays even longer inside memory than instance variables.

Access modifiers:
Access modifiers are keyword in java that define from where a certain variable, method or a class etc. can be accessed.
There are 4 types of access in java that we can define using three keywords.
keywords are:
1) Private
2) Keywords are Protected
3) Public
Types of access are 4:
1) Private(Keyword is also called private)
2) default(applied when no keyword is used)
3) protected
4) public
Private access (Keyword is private):
When we use the private with any of the variables , methods or class these can only be accessed with in that class.
When we don't use any of the keywords default access is applied by java to those variables method or class etc. which means
this thing can only be accessed from the same package.

Protected access (we used the projected class):
When projected access is applied class members(variables method etc) can be accessed from other packages but only in the
class that participate in inheritance.

Public access (public keyword):
public means class member
