Access Modifiers in Java:
Access modifiers allow us to control the visibility of class members(fields, methods, constructor, etc.)
and classes itself in java.
There are 4 access levels and there keywords that we used to define these access level fourth level is applier
when don't use any access modifier keyword.
levels from most restricted to less restricted are
1) Private (keyword is also called Private)
2) default (No keyword means default access level)
3) protected (keyword is also called Protected)
4) Public (Keyword is also called Public)

Rules:
1) We should always prefer private access modifier for the fields. Because fields contain the data and the method of
   your class might use that data to perform some task if we don't perform sanity checks before setting the values to
   these fields our class and method might misbehave also the access of the data should be restricted so that not every
   one can access the data.

2) We can't use access modifiers with local variables.

CONSTRUCTORS

Constructors in java allows us to set the values of the fields of a class.
