Encapsulation in java:
                      Encapsulation is hiding the class variables by making them private and providing the
                      getter setter method

Benefits:
          Better control over the dat and security
Collections Framework:
                       Collections framework is a collection of interfaces and classes which have many method to store
                       manipulate the data.
method to store and manipulate the data
String name;
String name1;
String name2;
String[] names=new String[10];
Limitations of the array
             1) They are fixed in size once we have created an array we can't modify its
             2) Array don't have build- in methods.
Collections
             1) Dynamic in size
             2) They have built-in method to manipulate the data
             3) Collections framework doesn't work with the primitive data types.
                we have to use wrapper classes.
             4) When we convert the primitive dat type to non-primitive we call it boxing.

Boxing:
int num=10;
Integer wrapper=new Integer(num);//Boxing
Integer wrapper=num;

Double d =new Double(25.5);
double num4=d.doubleValue();//un-boxing
double num5=d; auto un-boxing
