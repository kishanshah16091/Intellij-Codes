Constructors in Java:
Constructors in java are special block of code similar to method that initialize the object of a class.
Rules:
1) They don't have return not even void
2) Name of the constructor must be same as name of the class.
3) Constructors can't have non access modifiers like static final etc.
4) We can use the access modifiers like public private protected with constructors.
5) If we don't write a constructor in a class a default constructor is provided by compiler
6) we can have multiple constructors in class but their number of argument sequence of argument or
   type of argument should be different.
7) If we have multiple constructor then java decide which constructor to call based on the parameters we pass

this keyword:
It is a reserved keyword in java that we can use to refer to instance variables method or constructors of a class
1) "this" keyword is used to distinguish instance variable with local variables
2) I can use "this" keyword to call the constructor of call inside another constructor
3) We can use the "this" keyword to call the method of a class
Rules:
1) this() should be the first line inside a constructor
2) this() can't be used inside method

Inheritance

//default - within same package
  public - within same project
