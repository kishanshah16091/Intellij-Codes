Inheritance in java:
It's a mechanism in java through which a child class gets the properties and method from a parents.

Benefits:
1) Saves time to code
2) code duplication is reduced
3) eExecution time faster

Disadvantage:
Classes are tightly coupled if we change something in parent class it is also changed in the child class.

Types of inheritance:
1) Single
2) Hierarchical
3) Multilevel
4) Multiple (not supported in Java)

Single inheritance:
In single inheritance we have only one child and one parent class.
participate in inheritance one as child one as parents.

class parent{
}
class Child extends Parent{

}

Hierarchical:
In Hierarchical inheritance we have a single parent class and multiple child classes
class Parent{
}
class Child1 extends Parent{
}
class Child2 extends Parent{

}

Multilevel
we have multiple levels of inheritance for example if we have classes A B C
class C will be inherited from B and B will be inherited from A.
class A{
}
class B extends A{
}
class C extends B{
}
==========================================================================================================
super keyword:
super keyword is like the "this" it refers to the parent class object for example we can access the fields method or
constructors of parent class inside the child class using this keyword.

Super is keyword like "this" keyword, but it refers to the parent class object. we can use the super keyword in 3
different ways.
1) To access the super class variables if we have same named variables in super class and base class.

2) If we have same methods name in parents and child we cna use the super keyword to access the parents class method
   otherwise by default java refers to the child class methods.

3) As constructors don't participate in inheritance we can use super() with to call the constructors from the parent
   class.

Rules:
1) If we have a constructor in the parents clas that takes two argument we must hav a constructor inside the child
   class that at least take those two arguments.

2) We can't use this() and super() inside the same constructor.
3) super can't be used in static methods

Method overloading in Java:
If we have sane name method in class with different number of parameters of different sequence of parameters of different
data types of the parameters it is called methods overloading.

add(int number, int number2){
}
add(int number, double number2){
}
add(double number, double number2){
}
add(double number, int number2){
}
add(int number, int number2, number3){
}
