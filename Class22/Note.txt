Inheritance in java:
It's a mechanism in java through which a child class gets the properties and method from a parents.

Benefits:
1) Saves time to code
2) code duplication is reduced
3) eExecution time faster

Disadvantage:
Classes are tightly coupled if we change something in parent class it is also changed in the child class.

Types of inheritance:
1) Single
2) Hierarchical
3) Multilevel
4) Multiple (not supported in Java)

Single inheritance:
In single inheritance we have only one child and one parent class.
participate in inheritance one as child one as parents.

class parent{
}
class Child extends Parent{

}

Hierarchical:
In Hierarchical inheritance we have a single parent class and multiple child classes
class Parent{
}
class Child1 extends Parent{
}
class Child2 extends Parent{

}

Multilevel
we have multiple levels of inheritance for example if we have classes A B C
class C will be inherited from B and B will be inherited from A.
class A{
}
class B extends A{
}
class C extends B{
}

super keyword:
super keyword is like the "this" it refers to the parent class object for example we can access the fields method or
constructors of parent class inside the child class using this keyword.
