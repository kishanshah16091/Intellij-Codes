Wrapper classes:
They are object type for all the primitive types. When we use the wrapper classes we get all the benefits of class
and objects for example we can have methods.
also, generics works with only classes.

Boxing in wrapper classes:
boxing happen when convert a primitive to corresponding wrapper type.
for example:
int num=10;
Integer num2=new integer(num); // Boxing

unboxing happens when we convert a wrapper object to a corresponding primitive type.
for Example:
Integer num2=new integer(10)
int num=num2.intValue();

Integer num=10; // autoBoxing
int num2=num; //auto unboxing

List (It is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by two classes ArrayList LinkedList)
1) We can store the duplicate values in lists
2) insertion order is maintained.

When to use ArrayList:
If most of the operations are reading and storing new data and not shifting or changing the position of data then
we should go with arrayList.

When to use LinkedList:
When most of the operations are related to changing the position of data or related to dat shifting then we should go
with linkedList.
