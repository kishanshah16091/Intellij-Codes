Collections Framework in Java:
   collection of classes that helps us manage and manipulate data in a better way
1) ArrayList
   1) This class has built-in methods like add() remove() clear() etc.
   2) Dynamic and can adjust their size at runtime.

ArrayList<> arrayList=new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList --> name of the class
<> --> diamond operator we specify the dat type

Wrapper classes
byte --> Byte
short --> Short
int --> Integer
double --> Double
char --> Character

Why wrapper classes
  1) we get built-in method
  2) a lot of framework don't support primitives

When to use primitive:
  1) When we care about the memory because primitive occupy 4 time less memory as compared to wrapper
  2) performance

when to use Wrapper
When we can about our ease.
